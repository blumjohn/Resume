# Objective
The purpose of this exercise was to take stock of my job skills following graduation from Georgetown (McDonough School of Business and Walsh School of Foreign Service), with a Master's in International Business and Policy. I wanted to juxtapose those skills against the science skills from my PhD a decade earlier, as well as identify with broader skills I've always had. Familiar with a Sankey diagram, it seemed to be one way to visualize what I could otherwise put on paper.

# Data
I created lists of hard and soft skills, put them into categories, and mapped how relevant each were for each job role I have had. This was done manually in excel in a matrix that could be used to construct the Sankey diagram. For each job role, I listed the skills and then caculated the percentage each skill was used for that job role. I also weighted each job role. I did not apply a time weight, for example my time at Georgetown was not weighted as 1/7th my time at UCSD.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
